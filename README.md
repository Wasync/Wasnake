Basic displaying of the snake and movement
I will watch a movie and work at the same time, surely I will be very productive

Well, I finished the movie... but it's a trilogy soo.. another!
Trying to do the input with bits. Doesn't seem to be working but I'll fix it....

I have given up on doing bit magic for the input.
Shame it took me half a day to realize it. I'm taking longer than I want to code this. I should be done tonight
At the moment I'm working on the map. Still deciding whether I want it to be a static thing or if I want to fetch it from a file

Done and done, though I might go the extra step and add pause and game over screen.
Even make custom maps a thing
The problem is find a way to open files in a way that works on any OS
